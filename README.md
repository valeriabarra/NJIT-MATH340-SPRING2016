## NJIT MATH-340 Applied Numerical Methods Lab material.

This repository contains material for the Laboratory of the MATH-340 Applied Numerical Methods class taught at NJIT in the Spring of 2016. Previous versions of this class were taught in Spring 2015, Fall 2014 and Spring 2014. The instructor of this class was Prof. Bruce Bukiet from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NJIT, and Valeria Barra (on GitHub as [@valeriabarra](https://github.com/valeriabarra)) was the Lab instructor, who indepedently designed/prepared, taught and graded all Lab material and assignments.  

Some of the Lab assignments refer to some problems and tables from the reference textbook, that for this class was chosen to be "Numerical Analysis" second edition, by Timothy Sauer.
